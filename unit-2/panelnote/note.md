# SETU Moodle Signup 2025

Your SETU Moodle account is set up and your details are as follows:


+ Your username is your student number (8-digit number - **leave out the leading 'W' if there is one**) followed by @wit.ie (e.g. 12345678@wit.ie) you must use this number as your username to login to Moodle.

+ You can log in to Moodle via this web address https://moodle.wit.ie/ or through the SET Website student Hub: https://www.setu.ie/current-students/student-hub

+ Please use the 'Other Users' Button on the Moodle login page.

+ Your initial password will be sent to you **via Slack**

+ When you log in for the first time you will be prompted to change this password to something more personal - **please remember this password**.

All communication (emails) from Moodle will currently be sent to your personal email address - we will transfer your SETU email account over on your Moodle account at a later date.

Note: This Moodle account is a manual account and can only be used to login to Moodle - you won't be able to use this account on any other SETU systems.

For all Moodle technical support please email moodle@setu.ie and please include your student number and any other relevant information such as the module title.
