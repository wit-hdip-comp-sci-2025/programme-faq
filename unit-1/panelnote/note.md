## 1. Do I have to read all of this FAQ?

Questions 1-7 are important and ideally you should read them carefully now. For the remainder, perhaps consult as needed.

## 2. What do I need to do to assure my place on the course?

By **December 4th** at the latest, upload ALL required **funding eligibility** documents on the Springboard portal. This [is the springboard portal site to use for this ](https://springboardcourses.ie/), and the features you need will be available on the SB portal from when you accepted your offer. In respect of a payslip or returner declaration, these must be ***dated*** only within 6 weeks of course start i.e. from November 20th and uploaded to the portal then. For applicants who have already uploaded some of these documents, please complete the remainder now.  **All** applicants must upload a redacted payslip OR employer letter dated from November 20th to validate *current* employment status to complete enrolment.

## 3. When & how do I pay the fees?

For Springboard Students, a fee of €900 must be paid as a once-off up front payment. This represents 10% of the course fee, the remainder is paid by Springboard.

SETU Finance will be in contact with you in due course to arrange payment.

Please note ‘returner’ applicants are exempt from the fee payment of €900. If you have  queries please contact Joan at [joan.mangan@setu.ie](mailto:joan.mangan@setu.ie) 

## 4. I have accepted the offer, what happens next?

By December 18th, please also do the following:

- Sign up and in to our Slack organisation (Q.6)
- Sign up for a Github account (Q.7)
- Make arrangements to attend Workshop 1 on January 10th, 2025 (Q.8)"

When all funding eligibility documents are validated on the Springboard portal you will receive the SETU registration instructions. Please upload all funding eligibility documents now.  All payslips and signed Returner letters will need to be dated **from November 20th**.  Only for those in receipt of DSP payments, the payment verification (payment slip) must be dated **from December 18th**.

You will receive a SETU email with your student number, email address and SETU network access details. You will use these credentials to access other services, which we will introduce as needed, so please take careful note of them.

## 5. Should I buy a new laptop/workstation?

If you have a reasonably modern laptop or workstation (say <= 3 years old), then this should be sufficient for the first semester. During that semester, as you link up with other students and get a sense of an optimum working environment, you may be in a better position to consider an upgrade.

If you do not have a reasonably modern laptop, you will need one almost immediately. Tune in to a dedicated channel on our Slack workspace as soon as possible if you need advice. See question 6.

## 6. What is Slack? How do I sign up?

Almost all communications, learning, administrative and social communication will take place on the Slack platform. If you are unfamiliar with Slack – please take a few minutes to familiarise yourself with the basics [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/help/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) . You can join the programme Slack Workspace for the course by clicking on this invitation here:

The signup / sign in steps are relatively straightforward. Feel free to use your personal email - this email will not not be revealed to other Slack members. Please configure your profile within Slack as soon as you are signed in.  We ask that you set your profile to contain your **correct full name in** addition to a **suitable representative profile image** of yourself. Once we have everyone on board with Slack, all communications will be via this medium. These may be general communications, module specific discussions or direct messages (DMs). Slack can be accessed via the web, dedicated desktop applications, tablet and mobile applications. We recommend that you install the Slack application on both your workstation and your phone.
